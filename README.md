# My-Singing-Monsters-Steamless

## About

The steam version of My Singing Monsters... without steam! This of course means you don't have access to your Steam account, but this version comes with two ways to play. You can either play a guest account or an email account. Guest accounts are automatically made when you press play, but email accounts are made when a guest account is bound to an email. This is what we recommend you do with your guest account to keep your data safe.

## Why?

Well with no need for Steam, you can play on a school computer, even if you've been banned on Steam, and even share an account with friends! (This is against My Singing Monsters ToS however)

## Install

Well for home use you can go to releases and download the installer to install it, but for cases where you can't use an installer, you can download the "Source Code" of the release as a zip. This isn't actually source code, it's just the files that get installed. A Windows Firewall popup may appear asking if the exe can access private and public networks, only selecting private networks should work fine, however, issues can sometimes occur if you don't select public networks. Just be sure to press allow.

## Arent game cracks illegal?

This isn't a crack. The game is free and on many platforms. Cracks are paid games with DRM removed, this is a free game which can communicate with Steam.
